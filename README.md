# IBM Data Science Capstone Project SpaceX

SpaceX is a private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company founded by Elon Musk in 2002. The company is known for its ambitious goals of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has achieved several milestones in the aerospace industry, including the development of the Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, as well as the Dragon spacecraft.

Our goal is to forecast the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX prominently features Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, pricing each launch at 62 million dollars. In contrast, other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. A significant portion of SpaceX's cost savings stems from their ability to reuse the first stage. Thus, accurately predicting the success of the first stage landing enables us to estimate the overall launch cost. This insight can prove invaluable for competing companies considering bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch contract.

**Objectives:**

Which factor has the most significant impact on a successful landing?

How does the success rate of landings change over time?

Which predictive model provides the most accurate forecast for a successful landing?
